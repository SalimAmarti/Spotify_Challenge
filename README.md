Motivations
-------

I have started this project in the context of the Onyx Data Dataset Challenge.

https://onyxdata.co.uk/data-dna-dataset-challenge/

Every month, they organize a data visualization context on a given dataset. We had one full month to work on it and submit an entry.

**[Update] I won the contest!! Click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/salimamarti_onyx-data-datadna-july-dataset-challenge-activity-6827307533888188416-qlPM/) to see the LinkedIn post about it.**

We used the dataset created by Yamac Eren Ay: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

Executive Summary
-------

- Over the years, energetic songs became more popular while acoustic songs have lost their mojo
- Most popular artists with more than 100 songs are Drake and Taylor Swift
- The most popular song is Peaches by Justin Bieber but popularity is influenced by recent songs (what people are mostly listening to today)
- Short track titles are more successful
- "Love" and "live" are the most used words in track titles
- Featuring and remixes are more popular than "normal songs"
- Most songs in the dataset are non-explicit but explicit songs are more popular on average
- Popularity decreases when track duration increases
- The higher the tempo, the higher the popularity


Approach
-------

I performed an EDA and tried to find as many insights as possible across most features available in the dataset.

Next steps / Improvements
-------

- I believe we were provided with a chunk of the dataset for the challenge. In the full one, I think there is "genre" data included. I would love to perform a genre analysis.
